# Drone Control and Reinforcement Learning Journey
Welcome to my journey through Reinforcement Learning (RL) and drone control/simulation. This repository documents my progress as I explore various aspects of drone modeling, control, and reinforcement learning. The ultimate goal is to develop a comprehensive understanding of multi-agent adversarial environments involving drones and to simulate it.
